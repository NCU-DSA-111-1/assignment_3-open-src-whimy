# Arithmetic coding v.s. Huffman coding

By using open-source of these two algorithm, comparing different method for encoding & decoding.

# Proper

1. Learn how to use open source.
2. Study others code.
3. Compare these Algorithm

# simple conclusion

    \item Huffman coding runs faster when processing big size data.
    \item Arithemtic coding runs faster when processing small size data.
    \item Both coding runs faster when decoding, slower when encoding.
