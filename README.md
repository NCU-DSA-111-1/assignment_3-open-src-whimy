# Arithmetic coding v.s. Huffman coding

By using open-source of these two algorithm, comparing different method for encoding & decoding.

# Proper

1. Learn how to use open source.
2. Study others code.
3. Compare these Algorithm

# simple conclusion

> Huffman coding runs faster when processing big size data.
> Arithemtic coding runs faster when processing small size data.
> Both coding runs faster when decoding, slower when encoding.
